# OpenTerminal-Shortcut

Open Terminal faster  

Choose your own shortcuts. Personally I like:  
`cmd-opt-\` to open Terminal  
`cmd-opt-]` to open Terminal at folder  

Note: You could just use the built in 'open Terminal at folder' shortcut and `cd` to go to your home directory. This Automator script just saves 3 clicks.  

## Setup

In macOS, double click the OpenTerminal workflow. Click install to setup as a service. 

System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services  

'Open Terminal at folder' is built in, so no need for a custom Automator service. Simply add your shortcut under 'Files and Folders'.  

At the bottom, find OpenTerminal under 'General'. Add your shortcut.
